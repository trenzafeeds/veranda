# veranda
Latin Square Testing

### Build Directions

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trenzafeeds/veranda.git
$ cd veranda
$ make
```
then call (with 7 as example input):

```bash
$ ./veranda 7
$ less result_file.txt
```
if you want to save that output:
```bash
$ mv result_file.txt my_saved_result.txt
```
The program will create a new result file for itself each time, overwriting the previous.
